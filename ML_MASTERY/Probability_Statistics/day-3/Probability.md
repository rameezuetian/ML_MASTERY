# Probability Foundations: How Likely Is This?

## The Doctor's Dilemma

Dr. Sarah runs a routine test on a patient. The test comes back **positive** for a rare disease that affects 1 in 1000 people.

The test is 99% accurate:

* If you HAVE the disease, it correctly says "positive" 99% of the time
* If you DON'T have it, it correctly says "negative" 99% of the time

**Question**: What's the probability this patient actually has the disease?

Most people (and many doctors!) say "99%".

The real answer? **About 9%.**

Surprised? This is why understanding probability properly can literally save lives - and it's the foundation of all machine learning.

<Warning>
  **Real Talk**: Probability is one of the most misunderstood topics. Our intuition is terrible at it. By the end of this module, you'll understand why our intuition fails and how to calculate correctly.

## What Is Probability?

At its core, probability answers: **"How likely is something to happen?"**

### The Coin Flip

```python  theme={null}
import random

def flip_coin():
    return random.choice(['Heads', 'Tails'])

# Flip 1000 times
results = [flip_coin() for _ in range(1000)]
heads_count = results.count('Heads')

print(f"Heads: {heads_count}/1000 = {heads_count/1000:.2%}")
```

**Output (varies):**

```
Heads: 497/1000 = 49.70%
```

The probability of heads is 0.5 (or 50%). This means:

* Over many flips, about half will be heads
* Any single flip is unpredictable
* Probability is about **long-run frequency**

</Frame>

**The Formula:**

$$
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of ways A can happen}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
$$

***

## Basic Probability Rules

### Rule 1: Probability is Between 0 and 1

$$
0 \leq P(A) \leq 1
$$

* **P(A) = 0**: Impossible (rolling a 7 on a standard die)
* **P(A) = 1**: Certain (rolling 1-6 on a standard die)
* **P(A) = 0.5**: Equally likely to happen or not

```python  theme={null}
# Die roll probabilities
die_outcomes = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

p_roll_7 = 0 / 6  # Impossible
p_roll_any = 6 / 6  # Certain
p_roll_even = 3 / 6  # 2, 4, or 6

print(f"P(roll 7): {p_roll_7}")
print(f"P(roll 1-6): {p_roll_any}")
print(f"P(roll even): {p_roll_even}")
```

### Rule 2: Complement Rule

The probability something **doesn't** happen is 1 minus the probability it does.

$$
P(\text{not } A) = 1 - P(A)
$$

  <img src="https://mintcdn.com/devweeekends/M9ZntNGqDsFZ-ibN/images/courses/statistics-for-ml/complement-real-world.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=M9ZntNGqDsFZ-ibN&q=85&s=7234e42ef9c59b53ce8b89e95bc84aeb" alt="Complement Rule - Rain Example" width="1080" height="1080" data-path="images/courses/statistics-for-ml/complement-real-world.svg" />
</Frame>

```python  theme={null}
# Weather example
p_rain = 0.30  # 30% chance of rain

p_no_rain = 1 - p_rain
print(f"P(no rain): {p_no_rain:.0%}")  # 70%

# Useful for "at least one" problems
p_single_die_not_six = 5/6
p_three_dice_at_least_one_six = 1 - (5/6)**3
print(f"P(at least one 6 in 3 rolls): {p_three_dice_at_least_one_six:.2%}")
```

### Rule 3: Addition Rule

For **mutually exclusive** events (can't happen together):

$$
P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$

```python  theme={null}
# Drawing a card
p_ace = 4/52
p_king = 4/52

# P(ace OR king) - can't be both!
p_ace_or_king = p_ace + p_king
print(f"P(ace or king): {p_ace_or_king:.2%}")  # 15.38%
```

For **non-mutually exclusive** events (can happen together):

$$
P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)
$$

```python  theme={null}
# P(ace OR spade)
p_ace = 4/52
p_spade = 13/52
p_ace_and_spade = 1/52  # Ace of spades!

p_ace_or_spade = p_ace + p_spade - p_ace_and_spade
print(f"P(ace or spade): {p_ace_or_spade:.2%}")  # 30.77%
```

### Rule 4: Multiplication Rule for Independent Events

Events are **independent** if one doesn't affect the other.

$$
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)
$$

```python  theme={null}
# Flipping a coin and rolling a die
p_heads = 1/2
p_six = 1/6

p_heads_and_six = p_heads * p_six
print(f"P(heads AND six): {p_heads_and_six:.2%}")  # 8.33%

# Password cracking: 4-digit PIN
digits = 10  # 0-9
combinations = digits ** 4  # 10,000
p_guess_correct = 1 / combinations
print(f"P(guess 4-digit PIN): {p_guess_correct:.4%}")  # 0.01%
```

***

## Conditional Probability: The Game Changer

Here's where it gets interesting. **Conditional probability** answers:

**"What's the probability of A, GIVEN that B already happened?"**

Notation: $P(A|B)$ reads as "probability of A given B"

### The Job Interview Example

You're applying for jobs. Here's some data:

```python  theme={null}
# 100 applicants total
data = {
    'has_experience': {'hired': 30, 'not_hired': 20},  # 50 total
    'no_experience': {'hired': 10, 'not_hired': 40}    # 50 total
}

# Overall probability of getting hired
total_hired = 30 + 10
total_applicants = 100
p_hired = total_hired / total_applicants
print(f"P(hired): {p_hired:.0%}")  # 40%

# BUT... what if you have experience?
experienced_hired = 30
total_experienced = 50
p_hired_given_experience = experienced_hired / total_experienced
print(f"P(hired | experience): {p_hired_given_experience:.0%}")  # 60%

# What if you don't have experience?
no_exp_hired = 10
total_no_exp = 50
p_hired_given_no_experience = no_exp_hired / total_no_exp
print(f"P(hired | no experience): {p_hired_given_no_experience:.0%}")  # 20%
```

**Key Insight**: The "given" information changes everything!

**The Formula:**

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}
$$

```python  theme={null}
# Verify with formula
p_hired_and_experienced = 30 / 100  # 0.30
p_experienced = 50 / 100  # 0.50

p_hired_given_exp_formula = p_hired_and_experienced / p_experienced
print(f"P(hired | exp) via formula: {p_hired_given_exp_formula:.0%}")  # 60% ✓
```

***

## Bayes' Theorem: The Most Important Formula

Now we can solve that medical test problem from the beginning.

**Bayes' Theorem** lets you flip conditional probabilities:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

In words: *The probability of A given B equals the probability of B given A, times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.*

### Solving the Medical Test Problem

Let's set up what we know:

* **P(Disease)** = 0.001 (1 in 1000 people have it)
* **P(Positive | Disease)** = 0.99 (test catches 99% of sick people)
* **P(Positive | No Disease)** = 0.01 (1% false positive rate)

We want: **P(Disease | Positive)** - given a positive test, what's the chance they're actually sick?

```python  theme={null}
# Known probabilities
p_disease = 0.001  # Prior: base rate of disease
p_positive_given_disease = 0.99  # Sensitivity
p_positive_given_no_disease = 0.01  # False positive rate

# Calculate P(Positive) using law of total probability
p_no_disease = 1 - p_disease
p_positive = (p_positive_given_disease * p_disease + 
              p_positive_given_no_disease * p_no_disease)

print(f"P(Positive test): {p_positive:.4f}")  # 0.011

# Apply Bayes' theorem
p_disease_given_positive = (p_positive_given_disease * p_disease) / p_positive

print(f"P(Disease | Positive): {p_disease_given_positive:.2%}")
```

**Output:**

```
P(Positive test): 0.0109
P(Disease | Positive): 9.02%
```

Only **9% chance** of actually having the disease, despite a "99% accurate" test!

</Frame>

### Why Is This So Low?

Let's think about 10,000 people:

```python  theme={null}
population = 10000

# How many actually have disease?
actually_sick = int(population * 0.001)  # 10 people
actually_healthy = population - actually_sick  # 9990 people

# Of the sick, how many test positive?
sick_positive = int(actually_sick * 0.99)  # ~10 true positives

# Of the healthy, how many test positive (false positives)?
healthy_positive = int(actually_healthy * 0.01)  # ~100 false positives!

# Total positives
total_positive = sick_positive + healthy_positive

print(f"Actually sick: {actually_sick}")
print(f"True positives: {sick_positive}")
print(f"False positives: {healthy_positive}")
print(f"Total positives: {total_positive}")
print(f"P(sick | positive): {sick_positive/total_positive:.1%}")
```

**Output:**

```
Actually sick: 10
True positives: 10
False positives: 100
Total positives: 110
P(sick | positive): 9.1%
```

**The Key Insight**: When the disease is rare, even a small false positive rate creates many false alarms that overwhelm the true cases!

## Bayes' Theorem in Machine Learning

This isn't just medical trivia. Bayes' theorem is the foundation of:

* **Spam filters** (Naive Bayes classifier)
* **Recommendation systems**
* **Medical diagnosis AI**
* **Text classification**
* **Bayesian neural networks**

Let's build a spam detector!

***

## 🚀 Mini-Project: Spam Email Detector

### The Problem

You receive an email with the word "FREE" in it. What's the probability it's spam?

### The Data

```python  theme={null}
# Training data: 1000 emails
total_emails = 1000
spam_emails = 400
ham_emails = 600  # "ham" = not spam

# Word frequency
emails_with_free = {
    'spam': 200,  # 200 spam emails contain "FREE"
    'ham': 30     # 30 legitimate emails contain "FREE"
}

emails_with_meeting = {
    'spam': 10,
    'ham': 250
}

emails_with_urgent = {
    'spam': 180,
    'ham': 40
}
```

### Step 1: Calculate Prior Probabilities

```python  theme={null}
# P(Spam) and P(Ham)
p_spam = spam_emails / total_emails  # 0.40
p_ham = ham_emails / total_emails    # 0.60

print(f"P(Spam): {p_spam:.0%}")
print(f"P(Ham): {p_ham:.0%}")
```

### Step 2: Calculate Likelihoods

```python  theme={null}
# P(word | Spam) - probability of word appearing in spam
p_free_given_spam = emails_with_free['spam'] / spam_emails
p_free_given_ham = emails_with_free['ham'] / ham_emails

print(f"P('FREE' | Spam): {p_free_given_spam:.0%}")  # 50%
print(f"P('FREE' | Ham): {p_free_given_ham:.0%}")    # 5%

p_meeting_given_spam = emails_with_meeting['spam'] / spam_emails
p_meeting_given_ham = emails_with_meeting['ham'] / ham_emails

print(f"P('meeting' | Spam): {p_meeting_given_spam:.1%}")  # 2.5%
print(f"P('meeting' | Ham): {p_meeting_given_ham:.1%}")    # 41.7%
```

### Step 3: Apply Bayes' Theorem

```python  theme={null}
def naive_bayes_spam(word, p_word_spam, p_word_ham, p_spam=0.4, p_ham=0.6):
    """
    Calculate P(Spam | word) using Bayes' theorem.
    """
    # P(word) = P(word|Spam)*P(Spam) + P(word|Ham)*P(Ham)
    p_word = p_word_spam * p_spam + p_word_ham * p_ham
    
    # Bayes' theorem
    p_spam_given_word = (p_word_spam * p_spam) / p_word
    
    return p_spam_given_word

# Email contains "FREE"
p_spam_free = naive_bayes_spam("FREE", 0.50, 0.05)
print(f"P(Spam | 'FREE'): {p_spam_free:.0%}")  # 87%

# Email contains "meeting"
p_spam_meeting = naive_bayes_spam("meeting", 0.025, 0.417)
print(f"P(Spam | 'meeting'): {p_spam_meeting:.0%}")  # 4%
```

### Step 4: Multiple Words (Naive Assumption)

The "naive" in Naive Bayes assumes words are independent:

```python  theme={null}
def naive_bayes_multi_word(words_data, p_spam=0.4, p_ham=0.6):
    """
    Calculate P(Spam | multiple words) assuming independence.
    
    words_data: list of (word, p_word_spam, p_word_ham)
    """
    # Start with prior
    log_spam = np.log(p_spam)
    log_ham = np.log(p_ham)
    
    # Multiply likelihoods (add in log space)
    for word, p_word_spam, p_word_ham in words_data:
        log_spam += np.log(p_word_spam + 1e-10)  # Add small value to avoid log(0)
        log_ham += np.log(p_word_ham + 1e-10)
    
    # Convert back and normalize
    spam_score = np.exp(log_spam)
    ham_score = np.exp(log_ham)
    
    p_spam_given_words = spam_score / (spam_score + ham_score)
    return p_spam_given_words

# Email: "FREE meeting URGENT"
words = [
    ("FREE", 0.50, 0.05),
    ("meeting", 0.025, 0.417),
    ("URGENT", 0.45, 0.067)
]

p_spam_multi = naive_bayes_multi_word(words)
print(f"P(Spam | 'FREE meeting URGENT'): {p_spam_multi:.0%}")
```

**Output:**

```
P(Spam | 'FREE meeting URGENT'): 71%
```

Even though "meeting" is a ham indicator, the strong spam signals from "FREE" and "URGENT" push the probability up!

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
  **Mistake 1: Ignoring Base Rates (Base Rate Fallacy)**

  A 99% accurate test for a rare disease (1 in 10,000) will mostly produce false positives. Most people who test positive won't have the disease. Always consider how common the thing you're testing for actually is.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Mistake 2: Confusing P(A|B) with P(B|A)**

  P(sick|positive test) is NOT the same as P(positive test|sick). This confusion has led to wrongful convictions and medical misdiagnoses. Bayes' theorem is the bridge between them.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Mistake 3: Treating Dependent Events as Independent**

  Drawing cards without replacement means probabilities change. P(2nd card is ace | 1st was ace) = 3/51, not 4/52.
</Warning>

## Interview Questions

<Accordion title="Question 1: The Two-Child Problem (Google)">
  **Question**: A family has two children. Given that at least one is a boy, what's the probability that both are boys?

  <Tip>
    **Answer**: 1/3, not 1/2!

    Possible outcomes for two children: BB, BG, GB, GG
    Given "at least one boy": BB, BG, GB (3 options)
    Both boys: BB (1 option)

    P(both boys | at least one boy) = 1/3

    This is counterintuitive because we're not told which child is the boy, so both orders (BG, GB) are possible.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Question 2: Birthday Problem (Amazon)">
  **Question**: In a room of 23 people, what's the probability that at least two share a birthday?

  <Tip>
    **Answer**: About 50%!

    It's easier to calculate the complement:
    P(no shared birthdays) = (365/365) × (364/365) × (363/365) × ... × (343/365)

    ```python  theme={null}
    import numpy as np
    p_no_match = np.prod([(365-i)/365 for i in range(23)])
    p_at_least_one_match = 1 - p_no_match
    print(f"P(shared birthday): {p_at_least_one_match:.1%}")  # 50.7%
    ```

    This is famously counterintuitive because we're comparing ALL pairs, not just pairs involving you.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Question 3: Monty Hall Problem (Classic)">
  **Question**: You're on a game show with 3 doors. Behind one is a car, behind the others are goats. You pick door 1. The host (who knows what's behind each door) opens door 3, revealing a goat. Should you switch to door 2?

  <Tip>
    **Answer**: Yes! Switching gives you 2/3 chance of winning.

    Initial pick: 1/3 chance of being right
    Switching: 2/3 chance of winning

    The key insight: The host's action gives you information. He always reveals a goat, so when you switch, you're essentially betting that your initial choice was wrong (which it probably was, 2/3 of the time).
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Question 4: Spam Classifier (Tech Companies)">
  **Question**: Your spam filter has 98% sensitivity and 95% specificity. If 5% of emails are spam, what fraction of emails flagged as spam are actually spam?

  <Tip>
    **Answer**: About 51%

    ```python  theme={null}
    p_spam = 0.05
    sensitivity = 0.98  # P(flagged|spam)
    specificity = 0.95  # P(not_flagged|not_spam)
    false_positive_rate = 0.05

    # P(flagged)
    p_flagged = sensitivity * p_spam + false_positive_rate * (1 - p_spam)
    # = 0.98 × 0.05 + 0.05 × 0.95 = 0.0965

    # P(spam|flagged)
    p_spam_given_flagged = (sensitivity * p_spam) / p_flagged
    # = 0.049 / 0.0965 = 0.508 or about 51%

    print(f"Precision: {p_spam_given_flagged:.1%}")
    ```

    Half of flagged emails are false positives! This is why spam filters need extremely high specificity.

## Practice Challenge

<Accordion title="Challenge: Build a Complete Bayesian Classifier">
  Build a simple sentiment classifier using Bayes' theorem:

  ```python  theme={null}
  import numpy as np
  from collections import defaultdict

  # Training data
  reviews = [
      ("great product love it", "positive"),
      ("terrible waste of money", "negative"),

  <summary>**Exercise 1: Card Game Probabilities** - Apply probability rules</summary>

  **Problem**: From a standard 52-card deck:

  1. What's the probability of drawing a King OR a Heart?
  2. What's the probability of drawing 2 Aces in a row (without replacement)?
  3. If you know the card is red, what's P(it's a Diamond)?

  **Solution**:

  ```python  theme={null}
  # 1. P(King OR Heart) - Use addition rule for non-mutually exclusive events
  p_king = 4/52
  p_heart = 13/52
  p_king_and_heart = 1/52  # King of Hearts

  p_king_or_heart = p_king + p_heart - p_king_and_heart
  print(f"P(King or Heart): {p_king_or_heart:.4f} = {16}/{52} = {4}/{13}")
  # Answer: 16/52 = 4/13 ≈ 0.3077

  # 2. P(2 Aces in a row without replacement)
  p_first_ace = 4/52
  p_second_ace_given_first = 3/51  # One less ace, one less card

  p_two_aces = p_first_ace * p_second_ace_given_first
  print(f"P(2 Aces in a row): {p_two_aces:.4f} = {4*3}/{52*51}")
  # Answer: 12/2652 = 1/221 ≈ 0.0045

  # 3. P(Diamond | Red) - Conditional probability
  # Red cards: 26 (13 Hearts + 13 Diamonds)
  # Diamonds: 13
  p_diamond_given_red = 13/26
  print(f"P(Diamond | Red): {p_diamond_given_red:.4f} = 1/2")
  # Answer: 0.5 - Half of red cards are diamonds
  ```

  <summary>**Exercise 2: Medical Diagnosis with Bayes** - Apply Bayes' theorem</summary>

  **Problem**: A disease affects 0.1% of the population. A test for the disease has:

  * Sensitivity (true positive rate): 99%
  * Specificity (true negative rate): 95%

  If someone tests positive, what's the probability they actually have the disease?

  **Solution**:

  ```python  theme={null}
  # Given probabilities
  p_disease = 0.001          # Prior: 0.1% have disease
  p_no_disease = 0.999       # 99.9% don't have disease

  p_positive_given_disease = 0.99    # Sensitivity
  p_positive_given_no_disease = 0.05  # False positive rate (1 - specificity)

  # Apply Bayes' theorem: P(Disease|Positive) = P(Positive|Disease) * P(Disease) / P(Positive)

  # First calculate P(Positive) using law of total probability
  p_positive = (p_positive_given_disease * p_disease) + \
               (p_positive_given_no_disease * p_no_disease)

  print(f"P(Positive): {p_positive:.4f}")  # ~5.09%

  # Now apply Bayes
  p_disease_given_positive = (p_positive_given_disease * p_disease) / p_positive

  print(f"P(Disease | Positive): {p_disease_given_positive:.4f}")  # ~1.94%
  print(f"As percentage: {p_disease_given_positive*100:.2f}%")

  # Surprising result! Even with a positive test, only ~2% chance of disease!
  # This is because the disease is rare (low prior), and the false positives
  # from the 99.9% healthy population overwhelm the true positives.

  # Verification table for 100,000 people:
  print("\n--- Verification for 100,000 people ---")
  population = 100000
  have_disease = int(population * p_disease)  # 100
  no_disease = population - have_disease       # 99,900

  true_positives = int(have_disease * p_positive_given_disease)  # 99
  false_positives = int(no_disease * p_positive_given_no_disease) # 4,995
  total_positives = true_positives + false_positives              # 5,094

  print(f"True positives: {true_positives}")
  print(f"False positives: {false_positives}")
  print(f"P(Disease|Positive) = {true_positives}/{total_positives} = {true_positives/total_positives:.4f}")

  <summary>**Exercise 3: Email Spam Classification** - Naive Bayes in action</summary>

  **Problem**: You're building a spam filter. Based on training data:

  * P(Spam) = 0.3, P(Not Spam) = 0.7
  * Word frequencies:
    * P("free" | Spam) = 0.8, P("free" | Not Spam) = 0.1
    * P("meeting" | Spam) = 0.1, P("meeting" | Not Spam) = 0.6

  Classify the email: "free meeting invitation"
  (Assume independence and only consider "free" and "meeting")

  **Solution**:

  ```python  theme={null}
  import numpy as np

  # Prior probabilities
  p_spam = 0.3
  p_not_spam = 0.7

  # Likelihoods
  p_free_given_spam = 0.8
  p_free_given_not_spam = 0.1
  p_meeting_given_spam = 0.1
  p_meeting_given_not_spam = 0.6

  # Naive Bayes: Calculate P(class) * P(word1|class) * P(word2|class) for each class

  # For Spam:
  score_spam = p_spam * p_free_given_spam * p_meeting_given_spam
  print(f"Score(Spam): {p_spam} × {p_free_given_spam} × {p_meeting_given_spam} = {score_spam:.4f}")

  # For Not Spam:
  score_not_spam = p_not_spam * p_free_given_not_spam * p_meeting_given_not_spam
  print(f"Score(Not Spam): {p_not_spam} × {p_free_given_not_spam} × {p_meeting_given_not_spam} = {score_not_spam:.4f}")

  # Normalize to get probabilities
  total = score_spam + score_not_spam
  p_spam_given_email = score_spam / total
  p_not_spam_given_email = score_not_spam / total

  print(f"\nP(Spam | email): {p_spam_given_email:.2%}")      # ~36%
  print(f"P(Not Spam | email): {p_not_spam_given_email:.2%}") # ~64%

  # Classification
  prediction = "Spam" if p_spam_given_email > p_not_spam_given_email else "Not Spam"
  print(f"\nClassification: {prediction}")  # Not Spam

  # The word "meeting" strongly indicates legitimate email,
  # outweighing the word "free" which could go either way.

  <summary>**Exercise 4: E-commerce Conversion Funnel** - Real-world conditional probability</summary>

  **Problem**: An e-commerce site tracks user behavior:

  * 10,000 visitors land on the homepage
  * 40% view a product page
  * Of those who view products, 25% add to cart
  * Of those who add to cart, 60% complete purchase

  Calculate:

  1. P(Purchase | Visited site)
  2. If you see someone at checkout, what's P(they complete purchase)?
  3. How many purchases do you expect from 10,000 visitors?

  **Solution**:

  ```python  theme={null}
  # Define funnel stages
  visitors = 10000

  # Stage probabilities
  p_view_product = 0.40
  p_add_cart_given_view = 0.25
  p_purchase_given_cart = 0.60

  # 1. P(Purchase | Visited) = P(View) × P(Cart|View) × P(Purchase|Cart)
  p_purchase = p_view_product * p_add_cart_given_view * p_purchase_given_cart
  print(f"P(Purchase | Visited): {p_purchase:.2%}")  # 6%

  # 2. P(Complete | At Checkout)
  # "At checkout" means they've added to cart
  p_complete_given_checkout = p_purchase_given_cart
  print(f"P(Complete | At Checkout): {p_complete_given_checkout:.2%}")  # 60%

  # 3. Expected purchases
  expected_purchases = visitors * p_purchase
  print(f"Expected purchases from {visitors:,} visitors: {expected_purchases:.0f}")  # 600

  # Bonus: Funnel breakdown
  viewed_products = visitors * p_view_product  # 4,000
  added_to_cart = viewed_products * p_add_cart_given_view  # 1,000
  purchased = added_to_cart * p_purchase_given_cart  # 600

  print("\n--- Funnel Breakdown ---")
  print(f"Visitors:        {visitors:,}")
  print(f"Viewed Products: {viewed_products:,.0f} ({viewed_products/visitors:.0%})")
  print(f"Added to Cart:   {added_to_cart:,.0f} ({added_to_cart/visitors:.0%})")
  print(f"Purchased:       {purchased:,.0f} ({purchased/visitors:.0%})")

  # Business insight: Biggest drop-off is View → Cart (75% abandon)
  # Focus optimization efforts there!

## Interview Prep: Common Questions

<Accordion title="Probability Interview Questions">
  **Q: Two cards are drawn from a deck without replacement. What's P(both are aces)?**

  > P(1st ace) = 4/52. P(2nd ace | 1st ace) = 3/51. Total = (4/52) × (3/51) = 12/2652 ≈ 0.45%

  **Q: A test is 95% accurate for a disease affecting 1% of population. If positive, what's P(have disease)?**

  > Use Bayes: P(D|+) = P(+|D)×P(D) / \[P(+|D)×P(D) + P(+|¬D)×P(¬D)] = (0.95×0.01) / (0.95×0.01 + 0.05×0.99) ≈ 16%

  **Q: What's the difference between independent and mutually exclusive events?**

  > Independent: Occurrence of one doesn't affect the other (e.g., two coin flips). Mutually exclusive: Both cannot occur simultaneously (e.g., getting heads AND tails on one flip). Note: Mutually exclusive events are NOT independent!

  **Q: You flip a fair coin 10 times and get 10 heads. What's P(heads on flip 11)?**

  > Still 50%! This is the gambler's fallacy. Each flip is independent; past results don't affect future outcomes.
</Accordion>

***

## Common Pitfalls

<Warning>
  **Probability Mistakes to Avoid**:

  1. **Base Rate Neglect** - Forgetting prior probabilities when interpreting test results
  2. **Confusing P(A|B) with P(B|A)** - P(positive|disease) ≠ P(disease|positive)
  3. **Gambler's Fallacy** - Believing past independent events affect future outcomes
  4. **Assuming Independence** - Many real-world events are correlated; check before multiplying probabilities
  5. **Ignoring Complement** - Sometimes P(at least one) = 1 - P(none) is easier
</Warning>

***

## Key Takeaways

<Note>
  **What You Learned**:

  * ✅ **Basic Probability** - P(A) = favorable outcomes / total outcomes
  * ✅ **Addition Rule** - P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
  * ✅ **Multiplication Rule** - P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B|A)
  * ✅ **Conditional Probability** - P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)
  * ✅ **Bayes' Theorem** - Update beliefs with new evidence; essential for ML
  * ✅ **Independence** - Events where one doesn't affect the other
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Bayes' Theorem Intuition**: Think of it as "updating your beliefs." You start with a prior (what you knew before), see evidence, and get a posterior (what you know after). This is exactly how many ML algorithms learn!
</Tip>

**Coming up next**: We'll learn about **probability distributions** - the patterns that randomness follows. This is where we discover the famous "bell curve" and understand why it shows up everywhere!
