# Describing Data: What's Normal?

## The House Hunting Problem

You're moving to Austin, Texas. You have a budget of \$500,000 and want to know: **Is that enough for a decent 3-bedroom house?**

You could look at one listing, but that's just one data point. You need to understand the **whole picture**.

Let's load some real data:

```python  theme={null}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# House prices in Austin (3-bedroom homes, in thousands)
prices = np.array([
    425, 389, 445, 520, 478, 395, 510, 462, 398, 485,
    512, 445, 468, 502, 389, 475, 498, 415, 528, 459,
    442, 495, 478, 410, 525, 465, 488, 435, 505, 472,
    1250,  # A mansion somehow in the dataset
    448, 492, 418, 485, 455, 508, 428, 475, 495, 462
])

print(f"Number of houses: {len(prices)}")
print(f"Cheapest: ${min(prices)}K")
print(f"Most expensive: ${max(prices)}K")
```

**Output:**

```
Number of houses: 41
Cheapest: $389K
Most expensive: $1250K
```

The range is $389K to $1250K. But that doesn't tell us what's "typical". We need better tools.

***

## Measures of Central Tendency: "What's Typical?"

### The Mean (Average)

The **mean** is what most people think of as "average" - add everything up and divide by the count.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintcdn.com/devweeekends/M9ZntNGqDsFZ-ibN/images/courses/statistics-for-ml/mean-math.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=M9ZntNGqDsFZ-ibN&q=85&s=54bd24a58a61ef55000da9da138f591d" alt="Mean Formula Visualization" width="1080" height="1080" data-path="images/courses/statistics-for-ml/mean-math.svg" />
</Frame>

The mathematical formula:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n}
$$

```python  theme={null}
def calculate_mean(data):
    """Calculate the arithmetic mean."""
    return sum(data) / len(data)

mean_price = calculate_mean(prices)
print(f"Mean price: ${mean_price:.1f}K")

# Or use NumPy
print(f"Mean (NumPy): ${np.mean(prices):.1f}K")
```

**Output:**

```
Mean price: $492.6K
```

Wait... $492.6K? Most houses are around $450K, but the mean is higher. What's happening?

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintcdn.com/devweeekends/M9ZntNGqDsFZ-ibN/images/courses/statistics-for-ml/mean-real-world.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=M9ZntNGqDsFZ-ibN&q=85&s=7cee7be6b1a99434ef2317da089c726c" alt="Mean Real World - Mansion Pulling Average" width="1080" height="1080" data-path="images/courses/statistics-for-ml/mean-real-world.svg" />
</Frame>

**The Problem with the Mean**: That \$1.25M mansion is pulling the average up! The mean is **sensitive to outliers**.

***

### The Median (Middle Value)

The **median** is the middle value when you sort the data. Half the values are above, half below.

```python  theme={null}
def calculate_median(data):
    """Calculate the median."""
    sorted_data = sorted(data)
    n = len(sorted_data)
    mid = n // 2
    
    if n % 2 == 0:  # Even number of elements
        return (sorted_data[mid - 1] + sorted_data[mid]) / 2
    else:  # Odd number of elements
        return sorted_data[mid]

median_price = calculate_median(prices)
print(f"Median price: ${median_price:.1f}K")

# Or use NumPy
print(f"Median (NumPy): ${np.median(prices):.1f}K")
```

**Output:**

```
Median price: $472.0K
```

**The median is \$472K** - much more representative of a "typical" house! The mansion doesn't affect it because it's just one value above the middle.

<Info>
  **When to use Mean vs Median?**

  | Use Mean When                   | Use Median When          |
  | ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
  | Data is symmetric               | Data has outliers        |
  | No extreme values               | Income/wealth data       |
  | You want total divided by count | You want "typical" value |
  | Example: Test scores            | Example: House prices    |
</Info>

***

### The Mode (Most Common Value)

The **mode** is the value that appears most frequently. Less useful for continuous data, but great for categories.

```python  theme={null}
from collections import Counter

def calculate_mode(data):
    """Find the most common value(s)."""
    counts = Counter(data)
    max_count = max(counts.values())
    modes = [val for val, count in counts.items() if count == max_count]
    return modes

# For house prices, mode isn't very useful (all unique)
# But for bedrooms:
bedrooms = [3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 3, 3, 2, 4, 3, 3]
mode_bedrooms = calculate_mode(bedrooms)
print(f"Most common bedroom count: {mode_bedrooms}")  # [3]
```

**Real-World Usage**:

* Most popular shirt size at a store
* Most common customer complaint
* Peak traffic hour

***

## Measures of Spread: "How Different Are Things?"

Knowing the center isn't enough. Consider these two neighborhoods:

```python  theme={null}
neighborhood_A = [450, 455, 448, 460, 452, 445, 458, 447, 453, 462]
neighborhood_B = [350, 550, 400, 500, 380, 520, 410, 490, 360, 540]

print(f"Neighborhood A - Mean: ${np.mean(neighborhood_A):.1f}K")
print(f"Neighborhood B - Mean: ${np.mean(neighborhood_B):.1f}K")
```

**Output:**

```
Neighborhood A - Mean: $453.0K
Neighborhood B - Mean: $450.0K
```

Almost the same mean! But look at the actual houses:

* **Neighborhood A**: All houses are between $445K-$462K (consistent)
* **Neighborhood B**: Houses range from $350K to $550K (huge variation)

We need to measure **spread**.

***

### Range (Simplest Measure)

```python  theme={null}
def calculate_range(data):
    return max(data) - min(data)

print(f"Range A: ${calculate_range(neighborhood_A)}K")
print(f"Range B: ${calculate_range(neighborhood_B)}K")
```

**Output:**

```
Range A: $17K
Range B: $200K
```

The range shows the difference, but it only uses two values and is sensitive to outliers.

***

### Variance: Average Squared Distance from Mean

**Variance** measures how far values typically are from the mean.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintcdn.com/devweeekends/M9ZntNGqDsFZ-ibN/images/courses/statistics-for-ml/variance-math.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=M9ZntNGqDsFZ-ibN&q=85&s=5f100952584db090c39cfcfb641c1477" alt="Variance Formula Visualization" width="1080" height="1080" data-path="images/courses/statistics-for-ml/variance-math.svg" />
</Frame>

**The Formula:**

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$

**Step by step:**

1. Find the mean
2. For each value, calculate distance from mean
3. Square each distance (makes all positive, penalizes big deviations)
4. Average the squared distances

```python  theme={null}
def calculate_variance(data):
    """Calculate population variance."""
    mean = sum(data) / len(data)
    squared_diffs = [(x - mean) ** 2 for x in data]
    return sum(squared_diffs) / len(data)

var_A = calculate_variance(neighborhood_A)
var_B = calculate_variance(neighborhood_B)

print(f"Variance A: {var_A:.1f}")
print(f"Variance B: {var_B:.1f}")

# Using NumPy
print(f"Variance A (NumPy): {np.var(neighborhood_A):.1f}")
print(f"Variance B (NumPy): {np.var(neighborhood_B):.1f}")
```

**Output:**

```
Variance A: 29.4
Variance B: 5040.0
```

Neighborhood B has **171x more variance** than A!

</Frame>

***

### Standard Deviation: Variance in Original Units

Variance is in "squared dollars" which is hard to interpret. **Standard deviation** brings us back to dollars.

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

```python  theme={null}
def calculate_std(data):
    """Calculate population standard deviation."""
    return np.sqrt(calculate_variance(data))

std_A = calculate_std(neighborhood_A)
std_B = calculate_std(neighborhood_B)

print(f"Std Dev A: ${std_A:.1f}K")
print(f"Std Dev B: ${std_B:.1f}K")
```

**Output:**

```
Std Dev A: $5.4K
Std Dev B: $71.0K
```

**Interpretation**:

* Neighborhood A: Houses are typically within ±\$5.4K of the mean
* Neighborhood B: Houses are typically within ±\$71K of the mean

<Warning>
  **Sample vs Population**: When working with a sample (not the entire population), we divide by (n-1) instead of n for variance. This is called **Bessel's correction**.

  ```python  theme={null}
  # Population variance (you have ALL data)
  np.var(data, ddof=0)

  # Sample variance (you have a sample from larger population)
  np.var(data, ddof=1)  # Default in pandas
  ```
</Warning>

***

## Percentiles and Quartiles: "Where Does This Value Rank?"

Going back to our Austin house prices - is \$500K expensive or affordable?

**Percentiles** tell you what percentage of values fall below a given number.

```python  theme={null}
# Remove the mansion outlier for cleaner analysis
prices_clean = prices[prices < 1000]

# Calculate percentiles
p25 = np.percentile(prices_clean, 25)
p50 = np.percentile(prices_clean, 50)  # Same as median!
p75 = np.percentile(prices_clean, 75)
p90 = np.percentile(prices_clean, 90)

print(f"25th percentile: ${p25:.1f}K")
print(f"50th percentile (median): ${p50:.1f}K")
print(f"75th percentile: ${p75:.1f}K")
print(f"90th percentile: ${p90:.1f}K")
```

**Output:**

```
25th percentile: $445.0K
50th percentile (median): $468.0K
75th percentile: $495.0K
90th percentile: $512.0K
```

**Your \$500K budget puts you at the 78th percentile** - you can afford 78% of houses in this area!

### The Interquartile Range (IQR)

The **IQR** is the range of the middle 50% of data:

$$
IQR = Q3 - Q1 = P_{75} - P_{25}
$$

```python  theme={null}
iqr = p75 - p25
print(f"IQR: ${iqr:.1f}K")

# Houses outside 1.5*IQR from quartiles are often considered outliers
lower_fence = p25 - 1.5 * iqr
upper_fence = p75 + 1.5 * iqr
print(f"Outlier thresholds: ${lower_fence:.1f}K - ${upper_fence:.1f}K")
```

**Output:**

```
IQR: $50.0K
Outlier thresholds: $370.0K - $570.0K
```

That \$1.25M mansion is definitely an outlier!

***

## Visualizing Data: See the Distribution

Numbers are great, but our brains understand pictures better.

### Box Plot (Box-and-Whisker)

```python  theme={null}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))

# With outlier
axes[0].boxplot(prices, vert=True)
axes[0].set_title('House Prices (with $1.25M mansion)')
axes[0].set_ylabel('Price ($K)')

# Without outlier
axes[1].boxplot(prices_clean, vert=True)
axes[1].set_title('House Prices (mansion removed)')
axes[1].set_ylabel('Price ($K)')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Histogram

```python  theme={null}
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.hist(prices_clean, bins=15, edgecolor='black', alpha=0.7)
plt.axvline(np.mean(prices_clean), color='red', linestyle='--', label=f'Mean: ${np.mean(prices_clean):.0f}K')
plt.axvline(np.median(prices_clean), color='green', linestyle='--', label=f'Median: ${np.median(prices_clean):.0f}K')
plt.xlabel('Price ($K)')
plt.ylabel('Number of Houses')
plt.title('Distribution of House Prices in Austin')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

        'Max': np.max(data),
        'Range': np.max(data) - np.min(data),
        'IQR': np.percentile(data, 75) - np.percentile(data, 25)
    }
    
    print(f"\n{'='*40}")
    print(f"Summary Statistics: {name}")
    print(f"{'='*40}")
    for key, value in stats.items():
        print(f"{key:12}: {value:>12.2f}")
    
    return stats

# Use it!
describe_data(prices_clean, "Austin House Prices ($K)")
```

**Output:**

])

# TODO: Calculate mean and median
# TODO: Which one better represents "typical" salary?
# TODO: Calculate standard deviation
# TODO: Identify outliers using IQR method
```

<Accordion title="Solution">
  ```python  theme={null}

  median_salary = np.median(salaries)

  print(f"Mean: ${mean_salary:.1f}K")
  print(f"Median: ${median_salary:.1f}K")

  # Median is better - CEO salary inflates mean
  # Typical employee makes ~$88K, not $105K

  std_salary = np.std(salaries)

  # IQR outlier detection
  q1 = np.percentile(salaries, 25)
  q3 = np.percentile(salaries, 75)
  iqr = q3 - q1
  lower = q1 - 1.5 * iqr
  upper = q3 + 1.5 * iqr

  outliers = salaries[(salaries < lower) | (salaries > upper)]
  print(f"Outliers: {outliers}")  # [450] - the CEO
  ```

### Exercise 2: Test Score Comparison

```python  theme={null}
# Two classes took the same test
class_A = [72, 75, 78, 80, 82, 85, 88, 90, 92, 95]

# TODO: Which class performed better on average?
# TODO: Which class was more consistent?
# TODO: If you had to bet on a random student getting 80+, which class?
```

<Accordion title="Solution">
  ```python  theme={null}
  print(f"Class A - Mean: {np.mean(class_A):.1f}, Std: {np.std(class_A):.1f}")
  print(f"Class B - Mean: {np.mean(class_B):.1f}, Std: {np.std(class_B):.1f}")

  # Class A: Mean 83.7, Std 7.5
  # Class B: Mean 83.0, Std 9.9

  # Class A performed slightly better on average
  # Class A was more consistent (lower std dev)

  # For 80+ bet:
  a_above_80 = sum(1 for x in class_A if x >= 80) / len(class_A)
  b_above_80 = sum(1 for x in class_B if x >= 80) / len(class_B)
  print(f"Class A: {a_above_80:.0%} got 80+")
  print(f"Class B: {b_above_80:.0%} got 80+")

  # Both 70%, but Class A is safer bet due to lower variance

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
  **Mistake 1: Always Using the Mean**

  The mean can be heavily influenced by outliers. For salary data, housing prices, or any skewed distribution, the median is often more representative.

  **Example**: In a company where 9 employees earn $50K and the CEO earns $5M, the mean salary is \$545K - wildly misleading!
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Mistake 2: Ignoring Units**

  Variance is in squared units, which can be hard to interpret. Standard deviation is in the original units, making it much more practical.

  **Example**: A variance of 10,000 dollars² is hard to understand. A std dev of \$100 is clear.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Mistake 3: Comparing Std Devs Across Different Scales**

  A std dev of $10K for house prices vs $10 for groceries aren't comparable. Use the coefficient of variation (CV = std/mean) to compare relative variability.
</Warning>

## Interview Questions

<Accordion title="Question 1: Mean vs Median (Facebook/Meta)">
  **Question**: You're analyzing user session lengths. The mean is 45 minutes, but the median is only 8 minutes. What does this tell you about the distribution?

  <Tip>
    **Answer**: This indicates a heavily right-skewed distribution with outliers. Most users have short sessions (around 8 minutes), but some power users have very long sessions that pull the mean way up. The median is more representative of the "typical" user experience.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Question 2: Outlier Detection (Google)">
  **Question**: You have a dataset of daily ad revenue. How would you identify outliers?

  <Tip>
    **Answer**: Use the IQR method:

    1. Calculate Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile)
    2. Calculate IQR = Q3 - Q1
    3. Outliers are values below Q1 - 1.5×IQR or above Q3 + 1.5×IQR

    Alternatively, use z-scores: values more than 3 standard deviations from the mean are typically considered outliers.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Question 3: Variance Application (Amazon)">
  **Question**: You're comparing two delivery drivers. Driver A has mean delivery time of 30 min (std dev 2 min). Driver B has mean 32 min (std dev 8 min). Which driver would you prefer?

  <Tip>
    **Answer**: Despite Driver A being slightly faster on average, the low variance is the key differentiator. Driver A is consistently fast (28-32 min range), while Driver B is unpredictable (could be 24-40 min). For customer satisfaction and logistics planning, consistency often matters more than a slightly faster mean.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Question 4: Percentiles in Practice (Netflix)">
  **Question**: We measure page load times. The mean is 2.5 seconds, but the 99th percentile is 15 seconds. What action might you take?

  <Tip>
    **Answer**: The 99th percentile (P99) being 6x the mean suggests there's a "long tail" of slow experiences. Even though 99% of users have decent load times, 1% are having a terrible experience. For a company with millions of users, that's a lot of frustrated customers. Focus on identifying what causes these edge cases - geographic regions, specific devices, or server issues.

## Practice Challenge

<Accordion title="Challenge: Analyze This Real Dataset">
  You're given website session data. Analyze it completely:

  ```python  theme={null}
  import numpy as np
  np.random.seed(42)

  # Simulate session durations (in seconds)
  # Mix of quick bouncers and engaged users
  short_sessions = np.random.exponential(30, size=800)  # Most users leave quickly
  long_sessions = np.random.normal(600, 120, size=200)  # Engaged users stay ~10 min
  sessions = np.concatenate([short_sessions, long_sessions])

  # Your tasks:
  # 1. Calculate mean, median, std dev
  # 2. Identify which measure best represents "typical" session
  # 3. Find the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles
  # 4. Identify outliers using the IQR method
  # 5. What story does this data tell about user behavior?

  # Write your analysis here:
  ```

  **Solution**:

  ```python  theme={null}
  # 1. Basic statistics
  print(f"Mean: {np.mean(sessions):.1f} seconds")
  print(f"Median: {np.median(sessions):.1f} seconds")
  print(f"Std Dev: {np.std(sessions):.1f} seconds")

  # 2. The median (~47 sec) is more representative because the 
  #    distribution is heavily skewed by the engaged user segment

  # 3. Percentiles
  print(f"P10: {np.percentile(sessions, 10):.1f} seconds")
  print(f"P50: {np.percentile(sessions, 50):.1f} seconds")
  print(f"P90: {np.percentile(sessions, 90):.1f} seconds")

  # 4. Outliers using IQR
  Q1 = np.percentile(sessions, 25)
  Q3 = np.percentile(sessions, 75)
  IQR = Q3 - Q1
  lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
  upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
  outliers = sessions[(sessions < lower_bound) | (sessions > upper_bound)]
  print(f"Outliers: {len(outliers)} values")

  # 5. Story: Two distinct user groups!
  #    - 80% are "bouncers" with very short sessions
  #    - 20% are "engaged users" with ~10 minute sessions
  #    - This bimodal distribution suggests we should analyze 
  #      these groups separately
  ```

  <summary>**Exercise 1: Employee Salary Analysis** - Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation</summary>

  **Problem**: A company has the following employee salaries (in thousands):
  `[45, 52, 48, 95, 51, 49, 47, 250, 53, 50]`

  1. Calculate the mean salary
  2. Calculate the median salary
  3. Calculate the standard deviation
  4. Which measure (mean or median) better represents the "typical" salary? Why?

  **Solution**:

  ```python  theme={null}
  import numpy as np

  salaries = [45, 52, 48, 95, 51, 49, 47, 250, 53, 50]

  mean_salary = np.mean(salaries)
  median_salary = np.median(salaries)
  std_salary = np.std(salaries)

  print(f"Mean salary: ${mean_salary:.2f}K")      # $74.0K
  print(f"Median salary: ${median_salary:.2f}K")  # $50.5K
  print(f"Standard deviation: ${std_salary:.2f}K") # $59.24K

  # The median ($50.5K) better represents the typical salary because 
  # the mean is heavily influenced by the CEO's salary ($250K).
  # Most employees earn around $50K, not $74K.

  <summary>**Exercise 2: Website Performance Analysis** - Analyze load time percentiles</summary>

  **Problem**: You have 1000 page load times (in seconds). The data has:

  * Mean: 2.3 seconds
  * P50 (median): 1.8 seconds
  * P90: 4.5 seconds
  * P99: 12.0 seconds

  1. What does the difference between mean and median tell you?
  2. If you set an SLA at P90, what percentage of users experience worse performance?
  3. Calculate the ratio of P99 to P50. What does this indicate?

  **Solution**:

  ```python  theme={null}
  import numpy as np

  # Given statistics
  mean = 2.3
  p50 = 1.8
  p90 = 4.5
  p99 = 12.0

  # 1. Mean > Median indicates right-skewed distribution
  # There are some very slow page loads pulling the mean up
  print("Mean > Median: Right-skewed distribution (long tail of slow requests)")

  # 2. P90 SLA
  print(f"With P90 SLA at {p90}s, 10% of users (100 out of 1000) experience worse performance")

  # 3. P99/P50 ratio
  ratio = p99 / p50
  print(f"P99/P50 ratio: {ratio:.1f}x")
  # A ratio of 6.67x means the slowest 1% of requests are nearly 7x slower than typical
  # This indicates a "long tail" problem requiring investigation

  # Simulate similar data
  np.random.seed(42)
  load_times = np.concatenate([
      np.random.exponential(1.5, 900),  # Normal requests
      np.random.exponential(8, 100)      # Slow requests
  ])
  print(f"\nSimulated P50: {np.percentile(load_times, 50):.2f}s")
  print(f"Simulated P99: {np.percentile(load_times, 99):.2f}s")

  <summary>**Exercise 3: Outlier Detection in Transactions** - Use IQR method</summary>

  **Problem**: An e-commerce platform has the following transaction amounts:
  `[25, 30, 28, 35, 32, 29, 500, 27, 31, 33, 28, 750, 26, 30]`

  1. Calculate Q1, Q3, and IQR
  2. Determine the outlier boundaries using the 1.5×IQR rule
  3. Identify which transactions are outliers
  4. What might these outliers represent in real life?

  **Solution**:

  ```python  theme={null}
  import numpy as np

  transactions = [25, 30, 28, 35, 32, 29, 500, 27, 31, 33, 28, 750, 26, 30]

  # 1. Calculate quartiles
  Q1 = np.percentile(transactions, 25)
  Q3 = np.percentile(transactions, 75)
  IQR = Q3 - Q1

  print(f"Q1: ${Q1:.2f}")   # $27.75
  print(f"Q3: ${Q3:.2f}")   # $32.50
  print(f"IQR: ${IQR:.2f}")  # $4.75

  # 2. Outlier boundaries
  lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
  upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

  print(f"\nLower boundary: ${lower_bound:.2f}")  # $20.62
  print(f"Upper boundary: ${upper_bound:.2f}")   # $39.62

  # 3. Identify outliers
  outliers = [x for x in transactions if x < lower_bound or x > upper_bound]
  print(f"\nOutliers: {outliers}")  # [$500, $750]

  # 4. Real-world interpretation
  print("\nPossible explanations for outliers:")
  print("- Bulk/wholesale purchases")
  print("- Potential fraud requiring investigation")
  print("- High-value customers (VIP segment)")
  print("- Data entry errors (extra zeros)")

  <summary>**Exercise 4: Housing Market Analysis** - Real-world comprehensive statistics</summary>

  **Problem**: You're analyzing home prices in two neighborhoods:

  **Neighborhood A**: `[320, 335, 340, 328, 345, 332, 338, 342, 325, 330]` (in thousands)
  **Neighborhood B**: `[280, 450, 310, 520, 290, 380, 300, 480, 275, 420]` (in thousands)

  1. Calculate mean and standard deviation for both
  2. Calculate the coefficient of variation (CV = std/mean × 100%)
  3. Which neighborhood has more consistent pricing?
  4. A buyer with \$350K budget - which neighborhood should they focus on?

  **Solution**:

  ```python  theme={null}
  import numpy as np

  neighborhood_a = [320, 335, 340, 328, 345, 332, 338, 342, 325, 330]
  neighborhood_b = [280, 450, 310, 520, 290, 380, 300, 480, 275, 420]

  # 1. Calculate statistics
  mean_a, std_a = np.mean(neighborhood_a), np.std(neighborhood_a)
  mean_b, std_b = np.mean(neighborhood_b), np.std(neighborhood_b)

  print("Neighborhood A:")
  print(f"  Mean: ${mean_a:.1f}K, Std: ${std_a:.1f}K")  # Mean: $333.5K, Std: $7.4K

  print("\nNeighborhood B:")
  print(f"  Mean: ${mean_b:.1f}K, Std: ${std_b:.1f}K")  # Mean: $370.5K, Std: $85.1K

  # 2. Coefficient of Variation
  cv_a = (std_a / mean_a) * 100
  cv_b = (std_b / mean_b) * 100

  print(f"\nCoefficient of Variation:")
  print(f"  Neighborhood A: {cv_a:.1f}%")  # 2.2%
  print(f"  Neighborhood B: {cv_b:.1f}%")  # 23.0%

  # 3. Neighborhood A has much more consistent pricing (CV = 2.2% vs 23.0%)

  # 4. Budget analysis
  budget = 350

  affordable_a = [p for p in neighborhood_a if p <= budget]
  affordable_b = [p for p in neighborhood_b if p <= budget]

  print(f"\nWith ${budget}K budget:")
  print(f"  Neighborhood A: {len(affordable_a)}/{len(neighborhood_a)} homes affordable")
  print(f"  Neighborhood B: {len(affordable_b)}/{len(neighborhood_b)} homes affordable")
  # A: 8/10 homes, B: 5/10 homes

  # Recommendation: Focus on Neighborhood A - more options within budget
  # and predictable pricing makes comparison shopping easier

## Interview Prep: Common Questions

<Accordion title="Frequently Asked Interview Questions">
  **Q: When would you use median instead of mean?**

  > Use median when data has outliers or is heavily skewed. Classic examples: income data (billionaires skew the mean), house prices, response times (occasional timeouts).

  **Q: How do you detect outliers?**

  > Common methods: IQR method (1.5 × IQR beyond Q1/Q3), z-score method (beyond ±2 or ±3 standard deviations), visual inspection with box plots.

  **Q: What's the difference between population and sample variance?**

  > Population variance divides by n, sample variance divides by (n-1). Use n-1 for samples because it provides an unbiased estimate of population variance (Bessel's correction).

  **Q: A dataset has mean = median. What does this tell you?**

  > The distribution is likely symmetric (not skewed). In a perfectly symmetric distribution, mean = median = mode.
</Accordion>

## Common Pitfalls

<Warning>
  **Mistakes to Avoid**:

  1. **Using mean for skewed data** - Always check for outliers first; median is often more representative
  2. **Ignoring the spread** - Two datasets can have identical means but completely different distributions
  3. **Confusing variance units** - Variance is in squared units; use standard deviation for interpretable scale
  4. **Forgetting to visualize** - Statistics alone can be misleading (Anscombe's quartet is the classic example)
</Warning>

***

## Key Takeaways

<Note>
  **What You Learned**:

  * ✅ **Mean** - Sum divided by count; sensitive to outliers
  * ✅ **Median** - Middle value; robust to outliers; use for skewed data
  * ✅ **Mode** - Most frequent value; useful for categorical data
  * ✅ **Variance & Std Dev** - Measure spread around the mean
  * ✅ **Percentiles & IQR** - Divide data into portions; detect outliers
  * ✅ **Z-scores** - Standardize values across different scales
